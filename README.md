# Export Accepted Submissions from EasyChair and Convert to ACM ICPS File
Steps:
1. Go to *Status>All Submissions* and copy table with all submissions and save<sup>1</sup> it as `papers.csv`.
2. Go to *Administration>Authors>Email addresses*
    1. Copy table of "Corresponding Authors of Accepted Papers" and save<sup>1</sup> it as `co_authors.csv`.
    2. Copy table of "All Authors of Accepted Papers" and save<sup>1</sup> it as `authors.csv`.
3. Execute
```
python convert.py [EVENT_NAME] [PROCEEDING_ID] [PAPER_TYPE] [COPYRIGHT_CONTACT]
```

The parameters:
- `EVENT_NAME`: The name of the conference/workshop/etc.
- `PROCEEDING_ID`: You will find this data within ACMâ€™s instruction email (for ICPS proceedings, this is sent to the contact on file after the event was approved into the ICPS program). The proceedings ID is generated specifically for your proceedings.<sup>2</sup>
- `PAPER_TYPE`: The type of paper, e.g. `"Short Paper"`.
- `COPYRIGHT_CONTACT`: As this file was not generated by a conference management tool, a contact for copyright inquiries has to be provided. Enter the name in the format `"[FIRST_NAME] [LAST_NAME]"`.

The produced file will be written into the same directory named `[EVENT_NAME]-icps.csv`.
